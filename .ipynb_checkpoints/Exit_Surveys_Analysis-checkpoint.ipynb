    "# Why People Leave\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, We'll be analyzing two different datasets. One is a collection of exit surveys from the Department of Education, Training, and Employment, and the other is from the Technical and Further Education Institute in Queensland, Australia. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main objectives for this project:\n",
    "- Determine if employees are leaving due to some type of dissatisfaction and if this is different for short-term and long-term employees.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Determine if younger or older employees are resigning due to job dissatisfaction. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The Data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*** DETE Data ***\n",
    "\n",
    "The first dataset comes the Department of Education, Training, and Employment in Queensland, Australia.  It consists of 56 columns with 822 entries.  The first several columns describe information about the employee such as ID, classification, start and end date, and the business unit in which they worked. The rest of the columns describe reason for leaving their positions such as job dissatisfaction, ill health, and physical work environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "*** TAFE Data ***\n",
    "\n",
    "The second dataset comes from the Technical and Further Education Institute, also in Queensland. It consists of 72 columns with 702 entries. This dataset also includes basic information about the employee such as age, start date, cease date, and the date they began their final role. There are also a series of columns that appear to be yes or no questions about their positions such as 'I felt the salary was right for the responsibilities I had.' and 'I worked well with my colleagues.' These questions are divided into different categories: Institute Views, Work Unit Views, Induction Info, and Work Place Topic.  Additionally, there are several columns labeled 'Contributing Factors', each of which is a potential reaason for the employee's leaving.  \n",
    "\n",
    "*** Initial Impressions ***\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a lot of cleaning to be done here. There is no consistency between the two datasets and there are many null values and odd entries, such as the 'not stated' entries in DETE start date column. There are also numerous columns that aren't relevant to the problems. \n",
